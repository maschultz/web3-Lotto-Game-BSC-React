# web3 Lotto Game using Coinbase's WalletConnect Boilerplate and Custom Solidity Contract on BSC
Created in React, contract included

Install and run:

```
git pull
git status
npm i && npm run start
```

Deploy:

I prefer to use Vercel ([![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmaschultz%2Fweb3-Lotto-Game-using-Coinbase-s-WalletConnect-Boilerplate-and-Custom-Solidity-Contract-on-BSC)) so deploying happens automatically on each git push.
